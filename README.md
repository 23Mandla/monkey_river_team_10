# Monkey & River Hackathon 2025 â€“ Full Stack App

## ðŸš€ Challenge Overview

This project was built as part of the **#MonkeyAndRiverHackathon2025**, hosted by [Monkey & River](https://monkeyandriver.com) in collaboration with [Momentum Life Insurance](https://momentum.co.za) and [Otinga.io](https://otinga.io).

The goal was to bootstrap a full-stack application and implement core features including authentication, database connectivity, and a working CRUD interface for a chosen domain.

---

## ðŸ§± Stack Choice

**Frontend:** React  
**Backend:** Node.js + Express  
**Authentication:** JWT-based Auth  
**Database:** MongoDB (via MongoDB Atlas)

This stack was chosen for its flexibility, JavaScript end-to-end simplicity, and ease of setup â€” ideal for rapid development under time constraints.
